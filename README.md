# Ethereum Network Stats for the Trustlines Foundation

This is a visual interface for tracking the network status of blockchains by the
Trustlines Foundation. It uses WebSockets to receive stats from running nodes
and output them through and angular interface. It is the front-end
implementation for
[ethstats-client](https://github.com/trustlines-protocol/ethstats-client).

This is a fork of the [origin ethstats server
project](https://github.com/goerli/ethstats-server). It is an adjusted version
for the purpose of the [Trustlines
Blockchain](https://netstats.tlbc.trustlines.foundation/) and the
[Laika](https://netstats.laika.trustlines.foundation/) test network.

For further instructions of setup, usage, and more, please checkout the origin
repository.
